# Final Fantasy themed Trivia Game

### UNC Coding Bootcamp Week 5 Homework Project



**[https://bcoggins78.github.io/TriviaGame/](https://bcoggins78.github.io/TriviaGame/)**.

This is a trivia game based on the classic RPG video game Final Fantasy. The player clicks the start button which starts a timer and displays the questions.  If the player is able to answer the questions before the time runs out, they can click the finish button to see the results.  If time runs out, then the results are shown.  The player must get at least 70% of the questions right to win the trivia game. If won, the player will see the hero Cloud from Final Fantasy VII with the classic victory music.  If lost, then the infamous villain Kefka will be displayed with his notorious evil laugh.

Week 5 introduces the use of timers which was used in this project.  The project was built with: 

* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
